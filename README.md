jQuery Shopping List
====================

This is a shopping list app that uses local storage for data persistence (because creating a shopping list and accidentally refreshing a page is no fun) and some swiping features commonly seen in native mobile.

This app uses:
- [Gulp Web App Yeoman Generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp)
- [Hammer.js](http://hammerjs.github.io/)
  - To be added
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
